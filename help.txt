This plugin has 3 goals:

deploy:deploy
  Deploys an artifact to remote repository.

  Available parameters:

    altDeploymentRepository
      Specifies an alternative repository to which the project artifacts should
      be deployed ( other than those specified in <distributionManagement> ).
      Format: id::layout::url
      Expression: ${altDeploymentRepository}

    retryFailedDeploymentCount (Default: 1)
      Parameter used to control how many times a failed deployment will be
      retried before giving up and failing. If a value outside the range 1-10 is
      specified it will be pulled to the nearest value within the range 1-10.
      Expression: ${retryFailedDeploymentCount}

    skip (Default: false)
      Set this to 'true' to bypass artifact deploy
      Expression: ${maven.deploy.skip}

    updateReleaseInfo (Default: false)
      Parameter used to update the metadata to make the artifact as release.
      Expression: ${updateReleaseInfo}

deploy:deploy-file

    classifier
      Add classifier to the artifact
      Expression: ${classifier}

    classifiers
      A comma separated list of classifiers for each of the extra side artifacts
      to deploy. If there is a mis-match in the number of entries in files or
      types, then an error will be raised.
      Expression: ${classifiers}

    description
      Description passed to a generated POM file (in case of generatePom=true)
      Expression: ${generatePom.description}

    file
      File to be deployed.
      Required: Yes
      Expression: ${file}

    files
      A comma separated list of files for each of the extra side artifacts to
      deploy. If there is a mis-match in the number of entries in types or
      classifiers, then an error will be raised.

      the entire POM, and the <type> element in a dependency specification.
      Expression: ${packaging}

    pomFile
      Location of an existing POM file to be deployed alongside the main
      artifact, given by the ${file} parameter.
      Expression: ${pomFile}

    repositoryId (Default: remote-repository)
